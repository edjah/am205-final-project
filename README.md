This is a tool for automatically learning the parameters for a nonlinear partial differential equation of 2 variables. It also allows you to solve nonlinear PDEs.

### How to Use
This package requires Python 3.6+.

First, install all of the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### To run a demo

Simply run `python demo.py`. Feel free to open up the file and modify the `my_diffeq()` function to implement you own differential equation using pytorch operations.

Also feel free to modify the `true_fn()` definition in `main()` to construct your own base "image".

#### To generate figures
Simply run `python generate_figures.py`
